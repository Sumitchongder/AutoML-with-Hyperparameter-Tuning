## ML Model Performance Moonitoring Using Hyperparameter Tuning

The performance of a machine learning (ML) model depends on many factors, including the quality and quantity of the data, the choice of ML algorithm, and the values of hyperparameters used during training. 
Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before training the model and cannot be learned from the data. 
Examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate, number of hidden layers, number of nodes per layer, and
regularisation parameter. 
Hyperparameter tuning is the process of selecting the best set of hyperparameters for a given ML model to achieve optimal performance.

## Why Hyperparameter Tuning?

The project of monitoring the performance of an ML model using hyperparameter tuning is highly relevant in the field of machine learning. As the demand for ML models increases in various industries, it becomes crucial to ensure that these models perform well and continue
to do so over time.
Hyperparameter tuning is an essential step in optimizing the performance of an ML model.
By selecting the best hyperparameters, we can improve the accuracy, precision, and recall of the model. 
It also helps to avoid overfitting or underfitting of the model.
Moreover, monitoring the performance of an ML model over time is equally important. 
In real-world applications, the data may change, and the model's performance may degrade.
Regular monitoring of the model's performance can help us identify such scenarios and take corrective actions like retraining the model or adjusting the hyperparameters.
Thus, the project of monitoring the performance of an ML model using hyperparameter tuning is highly relevant and essential in ensuring the successful deployment of ML models in various real-world applications.

## Motivation of the Project

The motivation for the project of ML model performance monitoring using hyperparameter tuning is to improve the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models in real-world applications. 
Machine learning models are becoming increasingly prevalent in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. However, these models can be susceptible to performance degradation over time due to changes in the data or other factors.
Hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step in building accurate and reliable ML models. 
By selecting the best set of hyperparameters, we can improve the performance of the model and ensure its robustness to changes in the data. 
Additionally, monitoring the performance of the model over time can help identify when it needs to be retrained or when changes to the
hyperparameters are necessary.

Furthermore, the ability to monitor and improve the performance of ML models is becoming increasingly important in industries where errors can have serious consequences.
For example, in healthcare, an inaccurate model could lead to misdiagnosis or ineffective treatment. Therefore, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of ML models is of utmost importance.
